# AES-GCM-Ransomware-Simulation
This project implements a ransomware-style encryption and decryption system using the AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard â€“ Galois/Counter Mode) algorithm. The system demonstrates how modern cryptographic techniques can be used to secure sensitive files by encrypting entire folders and later restoring them through decryption.
